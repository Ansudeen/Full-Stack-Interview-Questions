# Full-Stack-Interview-Questions
Interview focused concepts related to OOPS, SQL, C#/.NET, UI and DevOps.

If one understands the WHY behind those questions, one would never have to worry about WHEN and WHAT. There is no striaght answer or fixed answer to any questions. 

Most questions are asked in an interview to understand the logical reasoning of the candidate. If a person is able to think hard and can come up with 2-4 solutions of a particular problem.

I would request you to write small code examples for these questions and understand what's happening behind the scenes. Your answer to the question must make sense to the interviewer.

#For interviewer : 
These questions might look easy and little theoretical but the answer to these questions would let you know a lot more about candidate. The way candidate will explain the answers, would give an idea of his knowledge and understanding of Software Engineering concepts.
